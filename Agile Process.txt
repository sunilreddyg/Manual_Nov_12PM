Agile Process:-->

	=> Agile is a iterative developement model.
	=> In agile total software divided into smaller stories.
	=> A set of stories organization develop and release 
		iteration wise.
	=> An iteration is a partial release where selected
		requirements develop and release to client.



	sprint:-->
		Sprint is a  time lock period where  few userstories 
		developed end to end.
		
		What is the duration of sprint:-->
			Mostly 1 week to 2 weeks


	What is the difference between iteration and sprint:-->
		
		=> When software successfully release to the
			client is called iteration succeessful

		=> Sprint can stop any time and plan for 
			new sprints incase information is
			lacking from client

		=> Sprint is to complete set of goals
		       arrange by scrum master..


Scrum:-->
	=> Popular developement framework in agile..
	=> other agile frameworks are 
		kanban [Reporting framework]
		FDD[Feature Driven Development]
		BDD[Behaviour driven development]


	Scrum Users:-->
		1. Product Owner    [Business Analyst]
		2. Scrum Master     
		3. Developement Team  and  QA Team
	


	Stage1:-->

		=> Product owner prioritize user stories from
		   backup folder.
		=> Product owner ask development team to give
			story points for each story to develop

	 What is Story points:-->
		story points represent the effort 
		to develop a story
					
	Who provide this story point:-->

		Everyone who involve into userstory developement 
		[Developer, Tester, Operational Team, Metric,Devops ---etc]

	What Goes Into a Story Point?

	The amount of work to do
	The complexity of the work
	Any risk or uncertainty while doing the work


				Developement :-->  5   *  8 ---> 40 hrs
				Tester	     :-->  3   *  8 ---> 24 hrs
				Operationals :-->  2   *  8 ---> 16 hrs

	How story points are calculated:-->

		=> usually each story point equals to  8 hours. 
		=> It is subject to project and organization.

	

		[Dynamic planning/ High Level Planning]

		
		=> Scrum master create sprint and assign 
			user stories to sprint

		=> Sprint is a duration of small period of time where
			all user stories to develop and test.
	
		=> Once user stories added to sprint Scrum master assign 
		   userstories to correspondent developer and tester.

		
	Stage2:-->

		
		=> After main task allocation scrum master ask team
			memebers to sketch out their own taks

		=> Scrum master track day to day team work and download
		   burndown charts to findout un accomplished tasks.
		
		
		What is Burndown chart?

			 => Burndown chart prepare by scrum master,
	       		    it is usefull to track developer and Tester
			    progress of work
		Why burndown charts?
		
	    		=> Use the Burndown Chart to track the 
			   total work remaining for a sprint, 
			   and to project the likelihood of achieving 
			   the sprint goal.
 
			=> By tracking the remaining work throughout 
	  	 	   the iteration, a team can manage its progress 
	  	 	   and respond accordingly.

			=> Incase of delay in work scrum master can remove
			   blockers and help team members to finish their
			   task intime..


		How they track work ?


		================================
		Todo   ||   Progress   ||  Done
		=================================

		Note:--> After completing each task developer,
			testengineer and other team memebers move 
			all taks from Inprogress state to done state.

			=> Before working on each task they drag
			    Todo to Progress state and Drag to Done
			    state once task is accomplished.....


============================================================================

	In BDD and FDD framework ogranization follow usestories to
	develop software features:-->
		

		[User stories are usefull to improve communication
			between business team and technical team]

		UserStory:-->
		A small narration of  requirement what client is
		expecting..

		As a ------I want ------So That

		
   		 As a (who wants to accomplish something)
    		 I want to (what they want to accomplish)
    		 So that (why they want to accomplish that thing)


		=> As a customer i want to add products to cart
		=> As a Merchant i want to add new product So that 
				user can purchase
							
	    Note:--> All user stories will be added to backup folder..



===========================================================================
	What is UseCase?.
		A Specific Requirement Based on StakeHolder View.
		=> It is a documented description it contains 
 			everything to develop and test software.

			=> PreCondition to Follow
			=> Post Condition to Follow
			=> Actors [Persons involve in software usage]
			=> Business Conditions and Special Requirements
			=> Errors
